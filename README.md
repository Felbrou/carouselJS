# � Image Carousel Project 

## � Project Overview
This project implements a dynamic image carousel using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The carousel allows users to navigate through a collection of images with smooth transitions and intuitive controls. This hands-on project was developed to deepen understanding of front-end web development fundamentals and DOM manipulation.

## �️ Technical Implementation

### � Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Provides the structural foundation for the carousel container and image elements
- **CSS3**: Handles styling, transitions, and animations for smooth image switching
- **JavaScript**: Powers the carousel's interactive features and manages state

### ⭐ Key Features
1. **Smooth Transitions**: Implemented CSS transitions for fluid image changes, enhancing user experience
2. **Navigation Controls**: Added previous/next buttons for manual navigation through images
3. **Automatic Slideshow**: Created an auto-play feature with configurable timing
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensured proper display across different screen sizes
5. **Indicator Dots**: Included navigation dots showing current slide position

### � Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### � State Management
- Implemented a tracking system for the current slide index
- Created logic to handle edge cases (first/last image wrap-around)
- Managed transition timing to prevent animation conflicts

#### � Event Handling
- Added touch support for mobile devices
- Implemented mouse drag functionality
- Created event listeners for keyboard navigation

#### ⚡ Performance Optimization
- Implemented image preloading to reduce load time
- Used CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Optimized JavaScript execution with debouncing
